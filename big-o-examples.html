    //==================
	//SPACE COMPLEXITY: Refers to
	//==================
	//Big O Notation in terms of space complexity is expressed just like it is with time complexity.  The difference here is that we are using it to express the amount of space needed to run our algorithm as the input (n) grows arbitrarily large.
		//Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are Constant Space or O(1)
		//Strings require O(n) space where n is the string’s length
		//Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)

	//Some rules of thumb:
		//Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are Constant Space or O(1)
		//Strings require O(n) space where n is the string’s length
		// Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)

	// Time Complexity: O(n) linear
